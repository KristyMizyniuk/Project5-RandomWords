# Project5-RandomWords
 The «Random Words» application is a random word database application. Users must create five new words from the initial word. So, this application has several features to work with. There is a «Refresh» button in the top left corner if users don't know how to create five words or just want to refresh and choose a new word. There is a «Plus» button in the top right corner that opens a pop-up window with a field where users can enter text. After submitting the correct answer users can see the new word on the screen. If users create incorrect words, they may see different types of pop-up notifications. After entering all five words the user sees a welcome pop-up message and moves to the next level with a new word.
